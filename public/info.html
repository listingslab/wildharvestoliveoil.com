Wild Harvest Olive Oil

From the Fleirieu and throughout South Australia, we harvest olives from wild trees and relinquished groves. Harvesting wild olives not only enhances the flavour and character of our award-winning oils, but helps protect native vegetation and ecology by preventing germination. Care has been taken to glean fruit from clean environments free from spray and roadside pollution. our oils are unfiltered, full of nutrients and pressed within two days. We hope you enjoy our oil as much as we do.

            <p>From the Fleurieu and throughout South Australia, Phil Mather, his family and
              friends harvest olives from wild trees and relinquished groves. Harvesting wild
              olives not only enhances the flavour and character of our award-winning oils,
              but helps protect native vegetation and ecology by preventing germination.</p>
            <p>Care has been taken to glean fruit from clean environments free from spray
              and roadside pollution.  Our oils are unfiltered, full of nutrients and
              pressed within two days of harvest. </p>
